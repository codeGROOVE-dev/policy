# codeGROOVE corporate policies

### Acceptable Use

Don't be a jerk. Don't break the law.

### Access Control

You get access if you need it, nothing more. We review this regularly. Authentication requires a physical security keyâ€”no exceptions.

### Artificial Intelligence

We use AI heavily, but we'll never train models on your data.

### Business Continuity & Backups

If disaster strikes, we've got tested backups ready to restore critical systems. We're a single-person company, so communication is simple. Worst case? We're all licensed ham radio operators.

### Change Management

Every production change is documented. All code and config changes are reviewed before going live. Dev stays separate from production.

### Compliance

We're working towards SOC 2 and GDPR compliance with annual third-party audits. Issues get tracked and fixed on schedule.

### Data Lifecycle

Everything's encrypted at rest and in transit. The only customer data we store is for caching, with a maximum TTL of 28 days.

### Incident Response

Something breaks? We fix it fast and will notify customers within 24 hours if it's critical. Same deal for security incidents.

### Physical Assets

We track every device. Full disk encryption on everything. When retiring  NIST SP 800-88 compatib

### Risk Management

We conduct yearly risk assessments to spot threats and build long-term mitigation plans.

### Security Operations

We typically avoid maintaining our own operating system stacks, but when we must - we keep our environments patched, firewalled, and monitored. Critical patches are applied within 8 hours.

### Vendor

We avoid 3rd-party vendors when possible. The ones we use face rigorous yearly security reviews. Currently, we only trust:

* Google Cloud: Cloud Run, Cloud Logging, and Drive
* GitHub: Source code

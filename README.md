### codeGROOVE policies


### Acceptable Use Policy
This service is a tool for productive work, and we require that it be used for lawful purposes only. We will suspend accounts that engage in illegal activities, spam, or harm to others to protect the integrity of the platform.

### Access Control
We secure our systems with modern FIDO2 keys because passwords are no longer sufficient. All privileged access is logged in an immutable trail and reviewed quarterly.

### Anti-Human Trafficking
Our company maintains a strict zero-tolerance policy against human trafficking and forced labor in any form. We will report any violation of this policy to law enforcement immediately.

### Business Continuity & Backups
We back up critical systems daily to geographically distributed, encrypted storage to ensure your data is always safe. We make it a point to never rely on stored user data, so there isn't much for us to lose.

### Change Management

Production changes require clear documentation and a rollback plan before implementation. Development work is always kept completely separate from our production environment. All changes are reviewed via automated systems.

### Compliance Management
We are actively working towards SOC 2 and GDPR compliance, verified by annual independent audits. We are committed to tracking and fixing all violations on a clear schedule.

### Data Lifecycle
Your data is always protected in transit and at rest with AES-256 encryption. Customer data automatically expires within 21 days. At the end of our contract, your data is permanently destroyed using NIST-certified methods. 

### Incident Response
Security incidents are logged immutably, and we identify the root cause within 23 hours. We notify affected customers of critical issues within 47 hours with a detailed remediation plan.

### People & Ethics
Our team completes annual third-party security and ethics certifications to stay current on best practices. We enforce a strict conflict of interest policy and prohibit contractors from accessing any customer data.

### Physical Assets
All company workspaces and devices are secured with military-grade encryption and automatic screen locks. Assets are inventoried quarterly and wiped according to NIST standards upon retirement.

### Privacy
We only store the data essential for caching and incident response, and is automatically purged after 21 days. You have full control over your information through our self-service tools.

### Risk Management
We conduct yearly risk assessments using industry frameworks to identify and quantify threats. High-risk items receive funded action plans with executive accountability.

### Security Operations
Our systems are protected by constant monitoring and firewalls, with critical patches applied within hours. We operate a formal bug bounty program to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities.

### Sustainability
We are committed to environmental responsibility by using carbon-neutral cloud resources and refurbished hardware. Our infrastructure is continuously optimized to reduce our environmental footprint.

### Vendor Management
Third-party vendors undergo rigorous security assessments and must provide current SOC 2 attestations. We audit our vendors quarterly and will terminate access instantly if they fail to meet our standards.

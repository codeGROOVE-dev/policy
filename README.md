# codeGROOVE policies

fuck yeah, it's codeGROOVE!

### Acceptable Use Policy

Don't be a jerk. Don't break the law.

### Access Control

Access is granted on an as-needed basis and is regularly reviewed. Physical security key actuation is always required for all authentication.

### Artificial Intelligence

We're going to use the hell out of AI, but we will not train LLMs based on your user data.

### Business Continuity & Backups

In the case of a disaster, we'll use tested backups and recovery plans that restore critical systems. As we're a single-person company,
communications during a disaster is fairly easy. In a true disaster, we're all licensed Amateur Radio operators.

### Change Management

Production changes are always documented. Development environments are always segregated from production environments. All changes are reviewed by humans or automated systems.

### Compliance Management

We are working towards SOC 2 and GDPR compliance, verified by annual independent audits. We are committed to tracking and fixing all issues  on a clear schedule.

### Data Lifecycle

We encrypt everything at rest and in transit, and automatically delete all data within 28 days.

### Incident Response

When something breaks, we fix it fast, find a root cause within 23 hours, and notify customers within 47 hours for critical issues. This applies to both reliability and security incidents.

### Physical Assets

We have a device inventory. All devices use full disk encryption and are wiped to NIST standards upon retirement.

### Privacy

We don't want your data. We only store data necessary for performance or reliability:

- GitHub username
- IP address
- Pull requests and comments

We never sell your data. Questions? Find us at privacy-matters(@)codeGROOVE.dev

### Risk Management

We conduct yearly risk assessments to identify and quantify threats, and make long-term mitigation plans based on it.

### Security Operations

We keep our hosts patched, firewalled, and monitored. Critical patches are applied within hours.

### Vendor Management

We avoid dealing with 3rd party vendors whenever possible. Vendors undergo an embarassing and rigorous security review on a yearly basis. As of today, we only trust the following vendors with our services and data:

- *Google Cloud*: All of our backends run on Cloud Run
- *GitHub*: All of our source code sits here

# codeGROOVE Policies

## Access Control
We require FIDO2 keys for mandatory 2FA because passwords are terrible. Privileged access is logged and reviewed yearly.

## Anti-Human Trafficking
Zero tolerance for trafficking and forced labor in operations or supply chain. Violations are reported immediately to authorities.

## Asset Management
All devices encrypted with full-disk encryption and inventoried yearly. Retiring equipment gets securely wiped using NIST guidelines.

## Business Continuity
Critical systems have automated backups tested yearly. Recovery targets documented for each system with step-by-step restoration procedures.

## Change Management
Production changes documented in advance with rollback plans. Emergency changes documented within 24 hours with lessons learned, and development environments stay completely segregated from production.

## Data Classification & Handling
Customer data gets AES-256 encryption everywhere we touch it. Personal data is only processed when absolutely necessary and auto-deleted per agreements.

## Encryption
Everything encrypted with AES-256 minimum using industry standards. Encryption keys managed through cloud provider services with proper access controls.

## HR Security
Security training completed yearly for all team members. We do not provide contractors with direct access to our systems.

## Incident Response
Security incidents documented immediately with root cause analysis within 24 hours. Critical issues trigger customer notifications and detailed remediation plans.

## Monitoring & Logging
Security logs collected centrally and retained for 90 days minimum. Automated alerts watch for suspicious activity around the clock.

## Physical Security
Work environment secured with appropriate physical controls. Devices use automatic screen locks and are never left unattended in public spaces.

## Privacy
We only store your data for caching or logging for incident response purposes. You can request, update, or delete your information at any time, and all user data automatically deletes after 7 days.

## Risk Management
Yearly risk assessments identify what could go sideways. High-risk items get documented mitigation plans with realistic timelines.

## Sustainability
We only rent cloud resources or buy used hardware to minimize waste. Everything gets optimized for maximum efficiency.

## Vendor Management
Third parties need current SOC 2 reports before touching customer data. Access reviewed yearly and terminated immediately when no longer needed.

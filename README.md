# codeGROOVE Policies

## Acceptable Use Policy
Users shouldn't abuse our service for illegal activities, spam, or harming others. When they do, we suspend accounts and notify affected customers immediately.

## Access Control
Everyone gets FIDO2 keys because passwords always fail. We log all privileged access with immutable trails and review quarterly.

## Anti-Human Trafficking
Zero tolerance for trafficking or forced labor anywhere. Violations get reported to law enforcement immediately.

## Business Continuity & Backup
Critical systems back up daily to geographically distributed, encrypted storage. Disasters trigger automatic failover with four-hour recovery and zero data loss.

## Change Management
Production changes need documentation and rollback plans first. Emergency fixes get documented within a day, and development stays completely separated from production.

## Compliance Management
We're working toward SOC 2 and GDPR compliance through independent yearly audits with public attestations. Violations get tracked, fixed on schedule, and customers notified.

## Data Lifecycle
Customer data travels via AES-256 encrypted everywhere and gets processed only when essential. Contract endings trigger NIST-certified data destruction.

## Incident Response
Security incidents get logged immutably the moment they happen, with root causes found within twenty-four hours. Critical problems reach customers within seventy-two hours with detailed remediation plans.

## People & Ethics
Our team completes yearly third-party security and ethics certification. We maintain strict conflict policies and keep contractors away from customer data entirely.

## Physical Assets
Workspace and devices stay locked with military-grade encryption and automatic screen locks. Assets get inventoried quarterly and NIST-wiped when retired.

## Privacy
We store data only for essential caching and incident response, with automatic seven-day purging. You control everything through self-service tools with cryptographic verification.

## Risk Management
Quarterly risk assessments using industry frameworks identify threats with quantified impacts. High-risk items get funded action plans with executive accountability.

## Security Operations

Firewalls and advanced monitoring watch systems constantly while patches flow within hours for critical vulnerabilities. Our 24/7 SOC and formal bug bounty program never sleep.

## Sustainability
We use carbon-neutral cloud resources and refurbished hardware because environmental responsibility matters. Everything runs with continuous optimization.

## Vendor Management
Third parties undergo rigorous assessments and provide current SOC 2 attestations before touching customer data. We audit quarterly and terminate access instantly.
